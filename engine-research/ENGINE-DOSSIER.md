# Engine dossier — Resident Evil Village sniper scope (RE Engine + REFramework)

The distilled technical reference for building a real VR sniper scope in
Resident Evil Village. Everything here was established by live probing on
2026-08-22 (methods in the
[dev archive](https://github.com/TefMeister/re-village-scope-vr-dev-archive))
or verified against REFramework's published sources and documentation.

## 1. The game and the framework

- **Game:** Resident Evil Village (`re8.exe`), Capcom RE Engine.
- **VR:** praydog's [REFramework](https://github.com/praydog/REFramework)
  native VR (no separate VR mod needed for RE8); injection via `dinput8.dll`.
- **Log file:** `re2_framework_log.txt` in the game root — REFramework uses
  that filename even for RE Village.
- **Scripting:** REFramework Lua (reflection over the managed type system,
  hooks, 2D drawing/ImGui). **No render-target, camera-creation, or
  render-pass API exists in Lua** — render infrastructure is native-only.

## 2. How the flat game implements the sniper scope

Two pieces, both confirmed live:

1. **Magnification = main-camera FOV zoom.** Aiming down the scope smoothly
   narrows the primary camera's FOV from ~63° to **24.37°** (~2.6×), and ramps
   it back on release. There is no second camera and no offscreen scope
   render — the whole frame is the "scope view."
2. **The scope look = `GUIScope`.** A GUI element with exactly three
   components — `via.Transform`, `via.gui.GUI`, `app.GUIScope` — drawn over
   the zoomed frame. It is a mask + reticle only: no render texture, no scene
   capture, no children.

Consequences for VR:

- A stereo headset view cannot adopt a fullscreen FOV zoom (wrong and
  sickening), so the magnification half of the trick is unusable as-is.
- REFramework's generic VR handling world-positions GUI elements along the aim
  ray, which turns the fullscreen mask into a giant floating plane — the
  well-known "huge flat screen with a crosshair" symptom.
- **Nothing exists to reuse:** a VR scope must create the magnified image
  itself.

Related engine facts:

- The equipped weapon is **its own GameObject**, not a component of the player
  (the player object carries body/motion/audio/physics components only). The
  scope-lens joint for mounting a picture-in-picture quad must be found on the
  weapon object.
- REFramework's `re8_vr.lua` already computes the true aim impact point via an
  async physics raycast (`via.physics.System.castRayAsync`) — the natural
  bore-sighting reference for a scope.

## 3. The REFramework native plugin API (what a scope plugin gets)

From the published SDK (`include/reframework/API.h`, v1.15.0, MIT):

- A plugin is a DLL in `reframework/plugins/` exporting
  `reframework_plugin_required_version(REFrameworkPluginVersion*)` and
  `reframework_plugin_initialize(const REFrameworkPluginInitializeParam*)`.
  **Plugins load at game start** — unlike Lua scripts, a script reset does not
  reload them.
- The initialize parameter provides:
  - `renderer_data` → `renderer_type` (`REFRAMEWORK_RENDERER_D3D11` /
    `D3D12`), `device`, `swapchain`, `command_queue` — everything needed to
    create GPU resources on the game's own device.
  - `functions` → callback registration: `on_present`,
    `on_pre_application_entry(name, cb)` / `on_post_application_entry`
    (module-entry boundaries such as `"BeginRendering"` / `"EndRendering"`),
    `on_device_reset` (recreate GPU resources here), `on_message`, ImGui frame
    hooks, `on_pre_gui_draw_element`, Lua-state lifecycle + lock/unlock, and
    `log_info/warn/error` into the framework log.

## 4. The VR scope design derived from all this

1. **Suppress the main-camera FOV zoom while scoped in VR** (Lua-reachable:
   the FOV is readable/writable on the primary camera; scoped state is
   detectable from `GUIScope` drawing or the FOV ramp itself).
2. **Hide the `GUIScope` mask in VR** (Lua-reachable:
   `on_pre_gui_draw_element` can suppress it, as REFramework already does for
   other elements).
3. **Render a magnified view to a texture** — the native plugin's job, on the
   device handed over at initialize. Two candidate routes, in test order:
   (a) drive the engine itself to render a second camera view (check for any
   latent second-camera path around the sniper first), else (b) a manual
   render pass. Note REFramework VR's "Single Frame Multipass" rendering
   technique when integrating.
4. **Composite the texture on a lens quad** at the weapon's scope joint,
   bore-sighted to the raycast impact point, only magnifying what the barrel
   actually points at.

Milestones: **M0** scaffold loads + callbacks fire → **M1** own a render
target and composite it visibly → **M2** magnified scene render into it →
**M3** lens quad + bore-sight + zoom suppression + mask hide in VR.

## 5. Probe technique notes (reusable)

- **Recon flat-screen first**: REFramework's VR handling is HMD-gated, so a
  monitor session shows the engine's native mechanism cleanly.
- **Hands-busy capture**: when inspecting a state that needs both hands on the
  controls (ADS), have the probe trigger its own dumps on the state transition
  (FOV threshold / element-draw recency), or on an armed timer — not on a UI
  click you cannot make.
- **Reflection gotcha**: a managed object's type name is
  `obj:get_type_definition():get_full_name()` — REFramework-native methods on
  the object. Routing them through `obj:call(...)` fails silently inside
  pcall guards.
